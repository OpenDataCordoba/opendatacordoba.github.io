            DataMade was born out of Chicago's Open Government community. In 2011, Derek and Forest started
            working on civic technology as volunteers of <a href="http://opencityapps.org/">Open City</a>. At nights and over weekends, they've helped make civic apps like <a href="http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/">Chicago Lobbyists</a>, <a href="http://clearstreets.org/">Clear Streets</a>, and <a href="http://secondcityzoning.org/">Second City Zoning</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2012, DataMade was founded to deepen and sustain the impact of civic technology.

        <p>Members of DataMade continue to prototype civic apps under the <a href="http://opencityapps.org/">Open City</a> banner to allow collaboration on open source projects without money or business getting in the way. When asked to re-deploy one of these apps (like <a href="http://datamade.us/products/look-at-cook/">Look at Cook</a>), the work is done by DataMade and kept as open source.</p>
        <p>DataMade also acts as the fiscal agent for the <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hack Night</a> in addition to being a recurring sponsor.</p>
